# Car_autopilot_simulation

An attempt to train a neural network by changing weights using a genetic algorithm. It does not work correctly, but it may help for any tasks.

File gen_alg.py contains functions for simulating the movement of a model car (triangle) along the track and for training a neural network (it may take a while). The visualization of movement takes place using PyGame.

File demo.py contains pre-trained weights for visualization.

I believe that the neural network has been overfitted in a certain area and requires improvements for correct training.
